A section of a World Economic Forum interview of Stuart Russell, a British computer scientist, on the advancements of AI technology. He states that an AI's uncertainty of its objective is what gives us more control over it, since it will need to factor in what we humans think is important before operating towards its objective. He then talks about how AI can bring about another wave of technological unemployment, and how an AI-dependent civilzation can disrupt the chain of knowledge that has been passed down among humans since the beginning of civilization. The video ends with Stuart Russell giving his opinions on when the arrival of general purpose AI will be-- while most experts say it will happen during the 21st century, he is more conservative and says it will take several brilliant minds and a few centuries in order for it to happen.

A video about ChatGPT in general. A reporter interviews ChatGPT itself, using text-to-speech software. She explains about OpenAI and how investments from big tech companies made ChatGPT possible. New concepts like the language model and generative AI are introduced, and how many companies are working on implementing their own generative AI. She then goes on to explain the use cases of ChatGPT (ex. review summarization, search engines) and its limitations (generates wrong answers and can be biased/toxic). Although these datasets have filtering processes, it has been reported that human labor had been used to label toxic, disturbing data for ChatGPT to learn, which left some workers traumatized. The video concludes by presenting future implications of generative AI: 1. technological unemployment of workers in the field of journalism, law, translation, and programming, 2. the impact on the educational system, and 3. issues regarding creativity and ownership of AI-generated content.
